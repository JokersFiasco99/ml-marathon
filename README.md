## 🔧 Getting Started

1. **Activate the environment:**
   ```bash
   conda activate ./env
   ```

2. **Launch JupyterLab:**
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

3. **Run the environment test:**
   Open `notebooks/01_environment_test.ipynb` and run all cells to verify everything is working.

## 🏃‍♂️ Ready for Your ML Marathon!

Your environment is now set up with all the essential tools for:
- Data exploration and preprocessing
